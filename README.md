# My Own AI/ML/DL Learning Process

*Tiny Note: as an active person who is into learning languages, I'll try to write this repo in different languages. This may include Japanese, Chinese, and Korean.*

Hi, I created this repo for listing projects made by myself in the AI/ML/DL learning process . Here it is:

こにちは，AI/ML/DL学習プロセスで　自分が　作成した　プロジェクトを　リストする　ために　このリポジトリを　作成しました．ここにあります：

(I listed references in each project link) (各プロジェクトの リンクに 参考文献を リストしました)

Ref for building this own NLP self-learning syllabus ( BUT only projects not related theory): 

* [Deep Learning in NLP Course](https://cole.vn/san-pham/khoa-hoc-deep-learning-in-natural-language-processing-793).

  P/s: I have not joined this Cole's course. Instead, I have been studying an AI/ML/DL Course by Master Tuan Linh & TA. It's great, the Master & Teaching Assistants are friendly and willing to answer questions from students, and I recommend others to join it too!
